# SQLSERVER_Electron
connecting SQLSERVER database in eletron app

if there is any error generated as there were many error generated while i was practicing this.
first of all check whether you have kept the web prefrences to node integration true or not.
then after check whether your server browser is running or not.
if it is not running then go and start your server browser you can do it from the services configuration setup of MSSQL
after all if there is error then check for the server port .
 and to understand it properly sonner i am going to upload a video on my youtube channel you can watch over there.
 
 if you find some errors in my code please write to me.
